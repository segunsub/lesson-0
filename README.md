Exercise 2: Describe what you notice and give details for why the output looks the way it does.
  When i export the object from lab.js the object was logged to the terminal when i
entered node marcy.js. The object was logged because that was what i sent from the lab.js file.

to the key favoriteNumber

  The console log in lab.js was logged onces, But I got the same object logged everytime
i console logged in marcy.js. This was because every call to require lab.js were all returning the same object and the lab.js file was read onces.
